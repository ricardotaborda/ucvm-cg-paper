\section{Recent UCVM Applications}

This section showcases three applications where the UCVM framework utilities have been used to advance recent research efforts on the evaluation of seismic velocity models, the simulation of realistic high-frequency ground motions, and the estimation of seismic hazard in southern California. These are important areas of study in seismology and earthquake engineering, and are parts of a larger research vision toward a physics-based approach to earthquake system science.
