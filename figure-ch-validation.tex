	\caption{Evaluation of validation results obtained for simulations of the 2008 Chino Hills earthquake using two different velocity models, CVM-S v4 (top) and CVM-H v11.9.1 (bottom). The evaluation includes comparisons of the two input models' \vs{} surface values (far-left), the simulation results for the surface peak ground velocity (center-left), the outcome of a goodness-of-fit validation analysis with respect to data where lighter colors indicate more accurate results (center-right), and the comparison of results with respect to empirical attenuation relationships used in engineering applications (far-right).
