  Abstract                 = {We estimate the ground motions produced by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake making use of the recently developed Song et al. (2008) source model that combines the available geodetic and seismic observations and recently constructed 3D geologic and seismic velocity models. Our estimates of the ground motions for the 1906 earthquake are consistent across five ground-motion modeling groups employing different wave propagation codes and simulation domains. The simulations successfully reproduce the main features of the Boatwright and Bundock (2005) ShakeMap, but tend to over predict the intensity of shaking by 0.1-0.5 modified Mercalli intensity (MMI) units. Velocity waveforms at sites throughout the San Francisco Bay Area exhibit characteristics consistent with rupture directivity, local geologic conditions (e.g., sedimentary basins), and the large size of the event (e.g., durations of strong shaking lasting tens of seconds). We also compute ground motions for seven hypothetical scenarios rupturing the same extent of the northern San Andreas fault, considering three additional hypocenters and an additional, random distribution of slip. Rupture directivity exerts the strongest influence on the variations in shaking, although sedimentary basins do consistently contribute to the response in some locations, such as Santa Rosa, Livermore, and San Jose. These scenarios suggest that future large earthquakes on the northern San Andreas fault may subject the current San Francisco Bay urban area to stronger shaking than a repeat of the 1906 earthquake. Ruptures propagating southward towards San Francisco appear to expose more of the urban area to a given intensity level than do ruptures propagating northward.},

Because Vp data are more common than Vs data, many researchers first develop a Vp model and convert it to a Vs model.

Wireline borehole logs, vertical seismic profiles, laboratory measurements, and seismic tomography models provide a diverse dataset for deriving empirical relations between crustal Vp and Vs. The proposed Vs as a function of Vp relations fit Vs and Vp borehole logs in Quaternary alluvium and Salinian granites as well as laboratory measurements over a 7-km/sec-wide range in Vp. The relations derived here are very close to those used to develop a regional 3D velocity model for southern California, based on pre-1970 data, and thus provide support for that model. These data, and these relations, show a rapid increase in Vs as Vp increases to 3.5 km/sec leading to higher shear-wave velocities in young sedimentary deposits than commonly assumed. These relations, appropriate for active continental margins where earthquakes are prone to occur, suggests that amplification of strong ground motions by shallow geologic deposits may not be as large as predicted by some earlier models.},

These rock types include the Jurassic and Cretaceous Franciscan Complex (metagraywacke and greenstones), serpentinites, Cretaceous Salinian and Sierra granites and granodiorites, Jurassic and Cretaceous Great Valley Sequence, and older Cenozoic sedimentary rocks (including the La Honda basin). Similar relations for less volumetrically important rocks are also developed for andesites, basalts, gabbros, and Sonoma Volcanics. For each rock type I summarize and plot the data used to develop the velocity versus depth relationships. These plots document the existing constraints on the proposed relationships. This report also presents a new empirical Vp versus depth relation derived from hundreds of measurements in USGS 30-m vertical seismic profiles (VSPs) for Holocene and Plio-Quaternary deposits in the San Francisco Bay area. For the upper 40 m (0.04 km) these mainly Holocene deposits, can be approximated by Vp (km/s) = 0.7 + 42.968z - 575.8z2 + 2931.6z3 - 3977.6z4, where z is depth in km. In addition, this report provides tables summarizing these VSP observations for the various types of Holocene and Plio-Quaternary deposits. In USGS Bay Area Velocity Model 05.0.0 these compressional wave velocity (Vp) versus depth relationships are converted to shear wave velocity (Vs) versus depth relationships using recently proposed empirical Vs versus Vp relations. Density is calculated from Vp using Gardner's rule and relations for crystalline rocks proposed by Christensen and Mooney (1995). Vs is then used to calculate intrinsic attenuation coefficients for shear and compressional waves, Qs and Qp, respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {Three-dimensional simulations of earthquakes have given a deeper understanding of wave propagation and site effects in urban regions. In this work we study the impact of a potential major earthquake on the San Andreas Fault with significant seismic hazard in the Greater Los Angeles Basin. We present results for the ShakeOut simulation---a rupture beginning near Salton Sea, California, heading 270 km northwest along the fault, that produces a Mw 7.8 earthquake in a geographical region which includes all major populated areas of Southern California and northern Mexico, in a 600 km by 300 km by 80 km volume, for a maximum frequency of 1.0 Hz and a minimum shear wave velocity of 200 m/s. For the material model, we use a discretized version of SCEC's CVM4 velocity model, called CVM-Etree. The simulation was performed at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center using Hercules, a finite element octree-based, parallel software developed by the Quake Group at Carnegie Mellon University. Hercules implements a highly efficient end-to-end algorithm for solving the wave field in highly heterogeneous media due to kinematic faulting. We verify our results by comparing synthetic seismograms computed with a parallel finite difference code by Robert Graves (URS) for a similar scenario earthquake, for a maximum frequency of 0.5 Hz and minimum shear wave velocity of 500 m/s. We focus our analysis of the results of the 1.0 Hz ShakeOut simulation on the Los Angeles Basin area, and the Santa Clara River Valley and Oxnard Plain. We examine the site effects present in these two areas and their proneness to capture and amplify seismic waves due to their geological features. Results show a direct correlation between the amplification levels and the local soil and basin profiles.},

M8 was calculated using a uniform mesh of 436 billion 40-m3 cubes to represent the three-dimensional crustal structure of Southern California, in a 800 km by 400 km area, home to over 20 million people. This production run producing 360 sec of wave propagation sustained 220 Tflop/s for 24 hours on NCCS Jaguar using 223,074 cores.

  Abstract                 = {We present a numerical method to simulate spontaneous shear crack propagation within a heterogeneous, 3-D, viscoelastic medium. Wave motions are computed on a logically rectangular hexahedral mesh, using the generalized finite-difference method of Support Operators (SOM). This approach enables modelling of non-planar surfaces and non-planar fault ruptures. Our implementation, the Support Operator Rupture Dynamics (SORD) code, is highly scalable, enabling large-scale, multiprocessors calculations. The fault surface is modelled by coupled double nodes, where rupture occurs as dictated by the local stress conditions and a frictional failure law. The method successfully performs test problems developed for the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC)/U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) dynamic earthquake rupture code validation exercise, showing good agreement with semi-analytical boundary integral method results. We undertake further dynamic rupture tests to quantify numerical errors introduced by shear deformations to the hexahedral mesh. We generate a family of meshes distorted by simple shearing, in the along-strike direction, up to a maximum of 73°. For SCEC/USGS validation problem number 3, grid-induced errors increase with mesh shear angle, with the logarithm of error approximately proportional to angle over the range tested. At 73°, rms misfits are about 10 per cent for peak slip rate, and 0.5 per cent for both rupture time and total slip, indicating that the method (which, up to now, we have applied mainly to near-vertical strike-slip faulting) is also capable of handling geometries appropriate to low-angle surface-rupturing thrust earthquakes. Additionally, we demonstrate non-planar rupture effects, by modifying the test geometry to include, respectively, cylindrical curvature and sharp kinks.},

  Abstract                 = {The finite-difference method is used to propagate elastic waves through a 3-D model of the Santa Clara Valley, an alluvium-filled basin that underlies the city of San Jose, California. The model was based on depth to bedrock information from water wells in the area. The simulation corresponded to a region 30 (east-west) by 22 (north-south) by 6 (depth) km and contained about 4 million grid points. Synthetic seismograms from the simulation are accurate at frequencies up to 1 Hz. Motions from a magnitude 4.4 aftershock of the Loma Prieta earthquake were modeled. Snapshots of ground motion and synthetic seismograms from the simulation are presented. The simulation illustrates S-to-surface-wave conversion at the edges of the basin and the large amplitude and long duration of ground motion in the basin compared to the surrounding rock. Love waves produced at the edge of the basin are the largest arrivals in the transverse synthetics. Because of the slow group velocity of the Love waves, sites near the center of the basin have longer durations of significant motions than basin sites near the valley edges. Sites near the center of the basin also show larger peak amplitudes on the transverse component. Array analysis of the synthetic seismograms indicates that Love waves tend to propagate parallel to the eastern and western edges of the valley. Rayleigh waves are produced along the southern margin of the basin from incident S waves. Large radial motions occur where a Rayleigh wave impinges on the northeast margin of the valley. Some Rayleigh waves travel westward across the basin, after being scattered from the eastern edge of the valley. Synthetic seismograms from the simulation have similar peak amplitudes as seismograms recorded by the Sunnyvale dense array for this aftershock, although the duration of the tranverse component is not matched by the synthetic seismogram, using this basin model. The simulation indicates that the Love waves observed on the actual seismograms were produced by conversion of incident S waves at the southern margin of the Santa Clara Valley. 2-D simulations show how the S-to-Love-wave conversion is affected by the angle of incidence of the S wave and the sharpness of the velocity transition between the alluvium and bedrock. As more accurate basin models are developed, 3-D simulations should become valuable for predicting ground motions in sedimentary basins for future large earthquakes.},

  Abstract                 = {The 2001 Big Bear Lake earthquake (Mw 4.63) was recorded by over 30 strong-motion instruments in the San Bernardino basin region of southern California. At periods longer than about 1 sec, the ground motions in the central portion of the basin have significantly larger amplitudes and extended durations of strong shaking relative to sites outside the basin. In many cases, the peak motions at the basin sites occur 10 or more seconds after the direct S-wave arrival, suggesting that these arrivals are controlled by basin-generated surface waves. To model these motions, I have performed finite-difference simulations using a 3D representation of the basin velocity structure. The basin structure has a minimum shear velocity of 250 m/sec, which coupled with the model grid spacing of 50 m yields a bandwidth resolution limit of T>1 sec for the numerical simulations. The simulations do quite well at reproducing the observed waveforms, amplitudes, and durations at periods of 3 sec and longer. At shorter periods (12 sec), the fit to the recorded motions is less well resolved, especially in matching the waveforms of the later-arriving phases. This suggests that in regions of complex geology, deterministic waveform modeling at periods approaching 1 sec involves more than simply reducing the minimum velocity threshold and, in particular, requires knowledge of the subsurface structure and distribution of seismic velocities at relatively short length scales (on the order of 50 m).},

  Abstract                 = {A 3D seismic velocity and attenuation model is developed for Santa Clara Valley, California, and its surrounding uplands to predict ground motions from scenario earthquakes. The model is developed using a variety of geologic and geophysical data. Our starting point is a 3D geologic model developed primarily from geologic mapping and gravity and magnetic surveys. An initial velocity model is constructed by using seismic velocities from boreholes, reflection/refraction lines, and spatial autocorrelation microtremor surveys. This model is further refined and the seismic attenuation is estimated through waveform modeling of weak motions from small local events and strong-ground motion from the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Waveforms are calculated to an upper frequency of 1 Hz using a parallelized finite-difference code that utilizes two regions with a factor of 3 difference in grid spacing to reduce memory requirements. Cenozoic basins trap and strongly amplify ground motions. This effect is particularly strong in the Evergreen Basin on the northeastern side of the Santa Clara Valley, where the steeply dipping Silver Creek fault forms the southwestern boundary of the basin. In comparison, the Cupertino Basin on the southwestern side of the valley has a more moderate response, which is attributed to a greater age and velocity of the Cenozoic fill. Surface waves play a major role in the ground motion of sedimentary basins, and they are seen to strongly develop along the western margins of the Santa Clara Valley for our simulation of the Loma Prieta earthquake.},

The inversion is performed using a damped least-squares conjugate gradient method (LSQR). The inversion model element spacing is 20 km. Before the inversion, the effects of crustal velocity heterogeneities represented by the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) seismic velocity model version 2 are removed from the teleseismic travel times. The P-wave inversion produces a variance reduction of 43 percent. S-wave velocities are determined from laboratory Vp/Vs ratios. The most prominent features imaged in the results are high P-wave velocities (+3 percent) in the uppermost mantle beneath the northern Los Angeles basin, and the previously reported tabular high-velocity anomaly (+3 percent) to depths of 200 km beneath the Transverse Ranges, crosscutting the San Andreas fault. We incorporate the upper mantle seismic velocity heterogeneities into the SCEC Southern California reference seismic velocity model. The prior accounting for the crustal velocity heterogeneity demonstrates the utility of the top-down method of the SCEC seismic velocity model development.},

  Abstract                 = {We obtain a seismic velocity model of the California crust and uppermost mantle using a regional-scale double-difference tomography algorithm. We begin by using absolute arrival-time picks to solve for a coarse three-dimensional (3D) P velocity (VP) model with a uniform 30 km horizontal node spacing, which we then use as the starting model for a finer-scale inversion using double-difference tomography applied to absolute and differential pick times. For computational reasons, we split the state into 5 subregions with a grid spacing of 10 to 20 km and assemble our final statewide VP model by stitching together these local models. We also solve for a statewide S-wave model using S picks from both the Southern California Seismic Network and USArray, assuming a starting model based on the VP results and a VP/VS ratio of 1.732. Our new model has improved areal coverage compared with previous models, extending 570 km in the SW–NE direction and 1320 km in the NW-SE direction. It also extends to greater depth due to the inclusion of substantial data at large epicentral distances. Our VP model generally agrees with previous separate regional models for northern and southern California, but we also observe some new features, such as high-velocity anomalies at shallow depths in the Klamath Mountains and Mount Shasta area, somewhat slow velocities in the northern Coast Ranges, and slow anomalies beneath the Sierra Nevada at midcrustal and greater depths. This model can be applied to a variety of regional-scale studies in California, such as developing a unified statewide earthquake location catalog and performing regional waveform modeling.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe Version 2 of the three-dimensional (3D) seismic velocity model of southern California developed by the Southern California Earthquake Center and designed to serve as a reference model for multidisciplinary research activities in the area. The model consists of detailed, rule-based representations of the major southern California basins (Los Angeles basin, Ventura basin, San Gabriel Valley, San Fernando Valley, Chino basin, San Bernardino Valley, and the Salton Trough), embedded in a 3D crust over a variable depth Moho. Outside of the basins, the model crust is based on regional tomographic results. The model Moho is represented by a surface with the depths determined by the receiver function technique. Shallow basin sediment velocities are constrained by geotechnical data. The model is implemented in a computer code that generates any specified 3D mesh of seismic velocity and density values. This parameterization is convenient to store, transfer, and update as new information and verification results become available.},

  Abstract                 = {We simulate ground motion in southern California from an ensemble of 7 spontaneous rupture models of large (Mw7.8) northwest-propagating earthquakes on the southern San Andreas fault (ShakeOut-D). Compared to long-period spectral accelerations from the Next Generation Attenuation (NGA) empirical relations, ShakeOut-D predicts similar average rock-site values (i.e., within roughly their epistemic uncertainty), but significantly larger values in Los Angeles and Ventura basins due to wave-guide focusing effects. The ShakeOut-D ground motion predictions differ from those of a kinematically parameterized, geometrically similar, scenario rupture: (1) the kinematic rock-site predictions depart significantly from the common distance-attenuation trend of the NGA and ShakeOut-D results and (2) ShakeOut-D predictions of long-period spectral acceleration within the basins of the greater Los Angeles area are lower by factors of 2√±3 than the corresponding kinematic predictions. We attribute these differences to a less coherent wavefield excited by the complex rupture paths of the ShakeOut-D sources.},

The model was developed using kriging techniques implemented in GoCAD (a commercial application specializing in the construction of surfaces, the analysis of spatially distributed data, and the modeling or simulation of properties) and is characterized by a heterogeneous, spatial varying velocity gradient with maximum velocities of ~5000 m/s in the sedimentary section. Variability of the observed P wave velocities increases with depth, reflecting complex structural and sedimentological controls. The model contains a new representation of the basin shape as defined by the sediment-basement interface, which was mapped using well control and seismic reflection profiles. Our model differs substantially in approach and outcome from previous representations of crustal velocity structure in southern California.},

We conduct a parametric study using Hercules, the parallel octree-based finite element earthquake simulator developed by the Quake Group at Carnegie Mellon University. Because of the necessity of performing repeated ground motion simulations , our analysis is based on the Domain Reduction Method (DRM), a modular two-step finite element methodology for modeling earthquake ground motion in highly heterogeneous localized regions. Buildings are included by modifying Hercules' finite-element meshing routines so that they are incorporated as additional block elements that are adjusted to emulate the general geometric and dynamic characteristics of buildings in city-like arrangements. We conduct our study in the greater Los Angeles basin using the main shock of 1994 Northridge earthquake for frequencies up to 2 Hz and a domain size of 85x85x42.5 km3 as the first step of the DRM. Then, we reduce the size of the region to a small subdomain of 2x2x1 km3 within the downtown Los Angeles region and introduce the building structures, for the second step of the DRM, in order to perform the repeated simulations of the parametric study.},

Unfortunately, the traditional information that the community possesses in this area is in the form of low-performance computational tools. For several years now, we have been using the in-house developed etree-library to construct etree versions of SCEC√≠s Community Velocity Model (CVM). We call them CVM-Etrees. They are discrete octree-based representations of the original CVM, with properties that greatly enhance the accessibility of the database. Although the construction of CVM-Etrees does not yet directly solve the performance issue by itself, it is a one time effort which results in a high-performance database that does speed up the process of repetitive mesh generations and material model exploration for preand post-processing analysis. This work explains our approach to storing the SCEC-CVM into etrees and examines their advantages and disadvantages compared to the current version of the CVM. We analyze the querying performance for data exploration and mesh construction processes, and the differences induced by the discretization procedure at different points in the Southern California region. We also present the current CVM-Etrees available to the community, which were recently used by different simulation groups as the primary material database source for the PetaSHA√≠s ShakeOut earthquake scenario.},

  Abstract                 = {This report describes a library, called the etree library, that allows C programmers to manipulate large octrees stored on disk. Octrees are stored as a sequence of fixed sized octant records sorted by a locational code order that is equivalent to a preorder traversal of the tree and a Z-order traversal through the domain. The sorted records are indexed by a conventional file-resident B-tree index and queried using fixed-length locational code keys. A schema can be defined to make an etree portable across different platforms. The etree library provides functions for creating, modifying, and searching octrees, including efficient mechanisms for appending octants and iterating over octants in Z-order. The library is the foundation for a larger research effort aimed at enabling scientists and engineers to solve large physical simulations on their desktop systems by recasting the simulation process to work directly on large etrees stored on disk.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe a technique to derive first-order site-condition maps directly from topographic data. For calibration, we use global 30 arc sec topographic data and VS30 measurements (here VS30 refers to the average shear-velocity down to 30 m) aggregated from several studies in the United States, as well as in Taiwan, Italy, and Australia. VS30 values are correlated against topographic slope to develop two sets of parameters for deriving VS30: one for active tectonic regions where topographic relief is high, and one for stable shields where topography is more subdued. By taking the gradient of the topography and choosing ranges of slope that maximize the correlation with shallow shear-velocity observations, we can recover, to first order, many of the spatially varying features of site-condition maps developed for California. Our site-condition map for the low-relief Mississippi Embayment also predicts the bulk of the VS30 observations in that region despite rather low slope ranges.We find that maps derived from the slope of the topography are often well correlated with other independently derived, regional-scale site-condition maps, but the latter maps vary in quality and continuity, and subsequently, also in their ability to match observed VS30 measurements contained therein. Alternatively, the slope-based method provides a simple approach to uniform site-condition mapping.After validating this approach in regions with numerous VS30 observations, we subsequently estimate and map site conditions for the entire continental United States using the respective slope correlations.},

  Abstract                 = {We generalize the formulation of probabilistic seismic hazard analysis to accommodate simulation‐based hazard models by expressing the joint probability distribution among the parameters of a kinematically complete earthquake rupture forecast in terms of a conditional hypocenter distribution and a conditional slip distribution. The seismological hierarchy implied by these dependencies allows the logarithmic excitation functional to be exactly and uniquely decomposed into a series of uncorrelated terms that include zero‐mean averages of the site, source, hypocenter, and source‐complexity effects. We use this averaging‐based factorization to compare the CyberShake prototype hazard model developed by the Southern California Earthquake Center, CS11, with the empirical ground‐motion prediction equations (GMPEs) of the 2008 Next Generation Attenuation (NGA08) project. For horizontal‐response spectral accelerations at long periods (2–10 s), the basin and directivity effects of CS11 are substantially larger than those of the NGA08 GMPEs. Directivity–basin coupling and other 3D wave propagation effects not represented in the GMPEs contribute significantly to the excitation patterns in CS11. The total variance of the CS11 excitations is about 60\% higher than the NGA root mean square (rms) at the 2 s period but almost 30\% lower at 10 s. Relative to the NGA rms, the residual variance in CS11 at 2 s is larger than the aleatory variability in the NGA08 database by a factor of nearly 1.6. Recent CyberShake experiments with alternative source and structural models suggest that the high CS11 variances are due to an overestimation of the basin and directivity effects at short periods. The CyberShake site and path effects unexplained by the NGA08 models account for 40\%–50\% of total residual variance, suggesting that improvements to the simulation‐based hazard models could reduce the aleatory variability intrinsic to the current GMPEs by as much as 25\%.},

  Abstract                 = {Consideration of site conditions is a vital step in analyzing and predicting earthquake ground motion. The importance of amplification by soil conditions has long been recognized, but though many seismic-instrument sites have been characterized by their geologic conditions, there has been no consistent, simple classification applied to all sites. As classification of sites by shear-wave velocity has become more common, the need to go back and provide a simple uniform classification for all stations has become apparent. Within the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Centerís Next Generation Attenuation equation project, developers of attenuation equations recognized the need to consider site conditions and asked that the California Geological Survey provide site conditions information for all stations that have recorded earthquake ground motion in California. To provide these estimates, we sorted the available shear-wave velocity data by geologic unit, generalized the geologic units, and prepared a map so that we could use the extent of the map units to transfer the velocity characteristics from the sites where they were measured to sites on the same or similar materials. This new map is different from the California Geological Survey ``preliminary site-conditions map of California'' in that 19 geologically defined categories are used, rather than National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program categories. Although this map does not yet cover all of California, when completed it may provide a basis for more precise consideration of site conditions in ground-motion calculations.},

  Abstract                 = {Green’s function approach is widely used in modeling seismic waveform. The representation theorem expresses the wave field as the inner product of the moment tensor and the spatial gradients of the Green’s tensor. Standard practice in waveform calculations has been to compute the Green’s tensors first and then obtain their gradients by numerical differentiation. The reciprocity of the Green’s tensor enables us to express the wave field explicitly in terms of the strain Green’s tensor, a third-order tensor composed of the spatial gradients of the Green’s tensor elements. We propose here to use the strain Green’s tensors rather than the Green’s tensors themselves in computing the waveforms. By bypassing the need for Green’s tensors and directly using the strain Green’s tensors, we can improve the computational efficiency in waveform modeling while eliminating the possible errors from numerical differentiation. The strain Green’s tensor elements are also directly related to the partial derivatives of the waveforms with respect to moment tensor elements and structural parameters. Through the inversion of the focal mechanisms of 27 small events in the Los Angeles region, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the strain Green’s tensor database approach in quickly recovering source parameters based on realistic 3D models. We show that the same database can also be used to improve the efficiency and accuracy in computing the Fréchet kernels for tomography inversions.},
