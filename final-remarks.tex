\section{Final Remarks}

Advances in recent years in physics-based earthquake system science highlights the importance of seismic velocity (crustal structure and geotechnical layer) models in seismology and earthquake engineering research. In this regard, the Unified Community Velocity Model software framework reviewed here is a versatile research tool to access the multiple velocity models in use by the scientific community today. Through standardized input and output processing tools, UCVM facilitates investigations into the effects that these models have on ground motion estimation, while also contributing to the continuous improvement of the models themselves. In this paper, we showed that UCVM offers a wide variety of programs and interfaces to allow users easy access to velocity models at both low (programming) and high (command-line) levels. We also showcased usage and application examples to illustrate the use of the framework and the current impact it has on simplifying research efforts on physics-based ground motion simulation and earthquake hazard analysis at regional scales. This review shows that the UCVM has become a well-accepted tool to register, disseminate, and access CVMs.
