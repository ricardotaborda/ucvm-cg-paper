\opening{Dear Dr. Caers:}

Please find attached the manuscript titled "The Unified Community Velocity Model Software Framework". This is a review paper on the development of the Unified Community Velocity Model (UCVM), a software framework for accessing and integrating community velocity models. UCVM has been developed by the Southern California Earthquake Center, headquartered at the University of Southern California, over the course of the last eight years. It is used successfully in deterministic physics-based earthquake ground-motion simulations as well as seismic hazard analysis applications. In our review we narrate the background, development, and applications of UCVM. We appreciate your consideration for publication.

Sincerely yours,

Patrick Small
